  /// {@endtemplate}
  ///
  /// The [title]'s width is constrained to fit within the remaining space
  /// between the toolbar's [leading] and [actions] widgets. Its height is
  /// _not_ constrained. The [title] is vertically centered and clipped to fit

  /// toolbar by default. On the other hand, it is noticeable when a
  /// widget with an intrinsic height that is greater than [toolbarHeight]
  /// is used as the [title]. For example, when the height of an Image used
  /// as the [title] exceeds [toolbarHeight], it will be centered and
  /// clipped (top and bottom), which may be undesirable. In cases like this
  /// the height of the [title] widget can be constrained. For example:
